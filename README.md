## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and how does it work with TencentCloud MCP Servers?

> The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables seamless integration between LLM applications and external data sources and tools. Whether you're building an AI-powered IDE, enhancing a chat interface, or creating custom AI workflows, MCP provides a standardized way to connect LLMs with the context they need.
>
> &mdash; [Model Context Protocol README](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context,context%20they%20need.)

An MCP Server is a lightweight program that exposes specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol. Host applications (such as chatbots, IDEs, and other AI tools) have MCP clients that maintain 1:1 connections with MCP servers. Common MCP clients include agentic AI coding assistants (like CodeBuddy, Cursor, Q Developer, Cline, Windsurf) as well as chatbot applications like Claude Desktop, with more clients coming soon. MCP servers can access local data sources and remote services to provide additional context that improves the generated outputs from the models.

TencentCloud MCP Servers use this protocol to provide AI applications access to TencentCloud documentation, contextual guidance, and best practices. Through the standardized MCP client-server architecture, TencentCloud capabilities become an intelligent extension of your development environment or AI application.

TencentCloud MCP servers enable enhanced cloud-native development, infrastructure management, and development workflows—making AI-assisted cloud computing more accessible and efficient.

The Model Context Protocol is an open source project run by Anthropic, PBC. and open to contributions from the entire community. For more information on MCP, you can find further documentation [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

### Why TencentCloud MCP Servers?

MCP servers enhance the capabilities of foundation models (FMs) in several key ways:

- **Improved Output Quality**: By providing relevant information directly in the model's context, MCP servers significantly improve model responses for specialized domains like TencentCloud services. This approach reduces hallucinations, provides more accurate technical details, enables more precise code generation, and ensures recommendations align with current TencentCloud best practices and service capabilities.

- **Access to Latest Documentation**: FMs may not have knowledge of recent releases, APIs, or SDKs. MCP servers bridge this gap by pulling in up-to-date documentation, ensuring your AI assistant always works with the latest TencentCloud capabilities.

- **Workflow Automation**: MCP servers convert common workflows into tools that foundation models can use directly.

- **Specialized Domain Knowledge**: MCP servers provide deep, contextual knowledge about TencentCloud services that might not be fully represented in foundation models' training data, enabling more accurate and helpful responses for cloud development tasks.

## When to use Local vs Remote MCP Servers?

TencentCloud MCP servers can be run either locally on your development machine or remotely on the cloud. Here's when to use each approach:

### Local MCP Servers
- **Development & Testing**: Perfect for local development, testing, and debugging
- **Offline Work**: Continue working when internet connectivity is limited
- **Data Privacy**: Keep sensitive data and credentials on your local machine
- **Low Latency**: Minimal network overhead for faster response times
- **Resource Control**: Direct control over server resources and configuration

### Remote MCP Servers
- **Team Collaboration**: Share consistent server configurations across your team
- **Always Available**: Access your MCP servers from anywhere, any device
- **Automatic Updates**: Get the latest features and security patches automatically
- **Scalability**: Easily handle varying workloads without local resource constraints

## Installation and Setup

Each server has specific installation instructions with one-click installs for CodeBuddy, Cursor and VSCode. Generally, you can:

1. Install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Install `npm` from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
3. Add the server to your MCP client configuration

Example configuration for TencentCloud CLI MCP:

See individual server READMEs for specific requirements and configuration options.

If you have problems with MCP configuration or want to check if the appropriate parameters are in place, you can try the following:

```shell
# Run MCP server manually with timeout 15s
$ timeout 15s uv tool run <MCP Name> <args> 2>&1 || echo "Command completed or timed out"
```

**Note about performance when using `uvx` *"@latest"* suffix:**

Using the *"@latest"* suffix checks and downloads the latest MCP server package from pypi every time you start your MCP clients, but it comes with a cost of increased initial load times. If you want to minimize the initial load time, remove *"@latest"* and manage your uv cache yourself using one of these approaches:

- `uv cache clean <tool>`: where {tool} is the mcp server you want to delete from cache and install again.
- `uvx <tool>@latest`: this will refresh the tool with the latest version and add it to the uv cache.

### Getting Started with CodeBuddy

<details>
<summary>Install in CodeBuddy</summary>

1. Follow the steps above in the **Installation and Setup** section to install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. Follow the steps above in the **Installation and Setup** section to install `npm` from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

3. You can place MCP configuration in two locations, depending on your use case:

Configure MCP servers in CodeBuddy settings or in `~/Library/Application Support/CodeBuddy/User/globalStorage/tencent.planning-genie/settings/codebuddy_mcp_settings.json`.

#### `codebuddy_mcp_settings.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudbase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["npm-global-exec@latest", "@cloudbase/cloudbase-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Getting Started with Cursor

<details>
<summary>Getting Started with Cursor</summary>

1. Follow the steps above in the **Installation and Setup** section to install `uv` from [Astral](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. Follow the steps above in the **Installation and Setup** section to install `npm` from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

3. You can place MCP configuration in two locations, depending on your use case:

  A. **Project Configuration**
    - For tools specific to a project, create a `.cursor/mcp.json` file in your project directory.
    - This allows you to define MCP servers that are only available within that specific project.

  B. **Global Configuration**
    - For tools that you want to use across all projects, create a `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file in your home directory.
    - This makes MCP servers available in all your Cursor workspaces.

#### `.cursor/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cloudbase": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["npm-global-exec@latest", "@cloudbase/cloudbase-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Using MCP in Chat** The Composer Agent will automatically use any MCP tools that are listed under Available Tools on the MCP settings page if it determines them to be relevant. To prompt tool usage intentionally, please prompt Cursor to use the desired TencentCloud MCP Server you wish to use. For example, `Using the COS MCP Server, do...`

4. **Tool Approval** By default, when Agent wants to use an MCP tool, it will display a message asking for your approval. You can use the arrow next to the tool name to expand the message and see what arguments the Agent is calling the tool with.
